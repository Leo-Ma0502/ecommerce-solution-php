# ecommerce-solution-php

This is a ecommerce web solution based on php.
This is a group project, most of codes are done by me and css templates are found by my team mates.
This project requires XAMPP environment, and the .sql is the database dump.
Key users are buyers who can signup, login, edit account, change payment information,
browse goods, manage cart & orders, make payment, ask for refund etc.
